<p> The following video is a tutorial of one of my favorite cartoonists, Christopher Hart, whose How to Draw books help me a lot in my life. </p> 

<p> Here's some information about him from his own website</p>

<p>"Christopher Hart is the world’s best-selling author of How-To-Draw books. Readers have gobbled up over six million copies of his titles. His work has been translated into more than 20 languages. Chris has had the rare distinction of having had the top 1, 2 & 3 art books in the country, simultaneously, as reported by Nielsen Bookscan.
 
Chris has also been featured on the cover of the publishing industry’s premier magazine, Publisher’s Weekly. He hosted How-To-Draw episodes for Comcast’s Activity TV channel, and has been featured on 20 videos for Howcast. His work has been licensed to art kits, board games and sports equipment.
 
Chris is known for his ability to create cute and dramatic characters, brimming with personality. He focuses on the most contemporary styles, genres, and techniques, in order to give his readers and fans the very latest in art instruction.
 
Few authors read and respond to every email they receive. But Chris does. Let him share his view on being an author: “It’s a privilege to be published as a cartoonist. I’m grateful to my readers, who make it happen. So if I can give something back, by offering a little encouragement, answering a question, or giving advice, why wouldn’t I? I honestly don’t understand authors who say they’re too busy to respond to their readers. The readers are why they are authors in the first place.”
 
In addition to his artwork, Chris also wrote original screenplays for 20th Century Fox, The Showtime Television Network, MGM Pathe’, and Paramount Pictures. He was a staff writer on several NBC, prime time comedies. And he was a regular contributor to Mad Magazine. His work has been published in a wide variety of magazines.
 
Chris studied art at the California School of the Arts, Paier School of Art, and the Silvermine School of Art. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from New York University."</p>
